Samples of my software development work


## Jenkinsfile 
This is the current revision of a Jenkins CICD Script I currently use to make flutter builds via updates of a bitbucket repository.

## logError.dart
In dart/flutter, there are no imperative types to dart developer logs. These are functions that I use to color output logs for ease of reading, especially when logging api requests in the same console as errors.

## postgres.sql
An authorization function I wrote, along with a trigger function run when a user creates an organization (business) within the client. This also includes some foreign data wrappers used to connect directly to the stripe api through postgres.
